# Fossil-Exploratory-Project
Using the PaleoBio Database, an exploration of the specimen occurrences of four families in the Order: Carnivora. An examination of geographic distribution over the Cenozoic Era is included. 

## Packages that were used for analysis
tidyverse, ggplot2, ggmap, fossils, dplyer

### Exploration of Data
A series of questions were generated prior to the start of data analysis that helped to drive the focus of the project. Process of data analysis included determining appropriate data from database, cleaning and tidying the data, then performing basic visualization methods on the resulting data. Additional variables were created using the mutate() function. Statistical analyses were also performed on the data. In addition, spatial analyses to determine changes in geographic distribution were also completed.
